## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-09

First public beta — the code-core engine plus the orchestration skill.

### Added

- **Engine (code-core, zero-dependency ESM):** `class-b.mjs` per-platform class-B discovery (Claude Code adapter; read-only, realpath-and-contained) · `caliper.mjs` footprint measurement, 4-band Memory-BMI verdict (LEAN/PLUMP/OBESE/FULL), deterministic economic break-even, lean-floor/stamp/snooze state · `fidelity-gate.mjs` mechanical zero-fact-loss gate (wikilinks/dates/versions/frontmatter inventory diff + encoding-corruption tripwires) · `apply.mjs` transactional apply (exclusive lock, marked snapshot, fsync'd WAL, atomic writes, deletes last, wholesale rollback, code-enforced human gate on deletes, `pinned: true` refusal) · `receipt.mjs` plain terse numbers block.
- **SessionStart conductor** (`hooks/coalwash-conductor.js`, Phoenix-13): the chokepoint gauge — silent on LEAN, band nudges with snooze, FULL force-run armed only by the shown break-even numbers; kind-1 self-update scheduling.
- **Skill** `skills/coalwash/SKILL.md` — the lean orchestration contract over the engine (Quick mechanical → consent-gated semantic Full with a zero-context outsider → fidelity gate → human gate → apply → receipt), with `references/method.md` (snippets, rubric, garbage taxonomy) and `references/platform-cc.md`.
- **Commands:** `/coalwash:stats` (measurement standard-system, read-only) · `/coalwash:update` (consent-gated self-update procedure).
- **Config system:** `.coalwash.json` global + per-project cascade, schema SSoT with clamped reads, commented factory template.
- **Docs:** README, SECURITY, PRIVACY (localOnly zero-transmission mode; receipts = metrics never content), CONTRIBUTING, Apache-2.0 LICENSE + NOTICE.
- **CI:** the flock's four SHA-pinned workflows (ci · codeql · markdownlint · scorecard), dependabot, issue templates.
- **Benchmark scaffold** (org `.github/benchmarks/CoalWash/`): protocol + planted fat/muscle fixtures + mechanical `score.mjs` for the sawtooth-vs-bloat and infinity-loop fact-loss measurements.
